# Non-reciprocal coevolution in a fungus-gardening ant

## 1. Phylogenetic tree estimation using RAxML
See `Tsept_PhylogeneticTree_RAxML/Tsept_PhylogeneticTree_RAxML.md` for methods for running RAxML.

## 2. Evaluating cophylogenetic signal between _T. septentrionalis_ and _Leucocoprinus sp._
See `Tsept_CophylogeneticSignal_coevo/Tsept_NonReciprocalCoevo_2025.Rmd` for methods of running tests of cophylogenetic signal. This analysis was performed using the mini-package available at [github.com/kbeigel/coevo](https://github.com/kbeigel/coevo).
